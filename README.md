# dBank
Simple example DeFi app on Ethereum blockchain, forked from [@gwmccubbin](https://github.com/gwmccubbin)'s tutorial

- Users can add Ether to a bank (DAO)

- Users earn interest over time

- Users get paid out interest in the "DBC" token created

- Users can borrow the "DBC" token from the DAO if they have submitted collateral (50% of collateral)

- Users must pay off the loan with the "DBC" token to unlock their original deposit
